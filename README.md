# Airbrakes Controller PCB

## Project Summary

This repository contains the design files for the **Airbrakes Controller PCB** developed for **Pitt SOAR** (Society of Aerospace Rocketry). The controller is designed to fit within a 3-inch diameter rocket and manages the airbrakes system for active flight control and apogee targeting.

The airbrakes controller integrates sensing, computation, and actuation to deploy airbrakes during powered and coast phases of flight, helping the rocket reach a precise target altitude.

## Assembly & Mounting Notes

- The PCB is designed for integration in a **3-inch diameter rocket** airframe.
- Ensure proper alignment with the airbrakes mechanism and secure mounting to withstand flight loads.
- Double-check connector orientations and secure all wiring harnesses before flight.
- Refer to schematic and 3D render images below for component placement and board layout.

## Usage

1. Review the schematic diagrams to understand the circuit design.
2. Use the 3D render to verify component placement and board dimensions.
3. Fabricate the PCB using the design files (if available) or order from a PCB manufacturer.
4. Assemble components per the schematic and test before integration.
5. Integrate into the rocket airframe and connect to the airbrakes mechanism.
